## Storybook

<hr>

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a component development tool that allows you to visualize and test components in isolation. This makes it easy to develop and test components, allowing you to see how they behave in different states and contexts.

### How to Run Storybook

- `yarn storybook`

This will start the Storybook server at http://localhost:6006 and you will be able to view your components in a friendly interface.
